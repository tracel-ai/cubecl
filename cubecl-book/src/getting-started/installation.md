# Installation
Installing CubeCL is straightforward. Itâ€™s available as a Rust crate, and you can add it to your project by updating your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies]
cubecl = {
    version = "0.7.0",  # Replace with the latest version from crates.io
    features = ["wgpu"]  # Enable desired runtime features (e.g., wgpu, cuda, hip)
}
```

The more challenging aspect is ensuring that you have the necessary drivers to run the selected runtime.

CubeCL supports multiple GPU runtimes, each requiring specific drivers or frameworks. Enable the appropriate feature flag in Cargo.toml and ensure the corresponding drivers are installed.

| Platform | Runtime  | Supported OS                | Requirements                                             | Installation/Notes                                                                                                                                   | Feature Flag              |
